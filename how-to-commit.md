# Solve the issue, commit-by-commit
Make a _series_ of "commits" to solve the issue (not just one big commit).

- **What is a commit, anyway?** 
  > 💡 ⛔️ TODO ⛔️ 

- Make a small change, making an improvement, then commit it. 
  
  > 📐 No commit is too small.
  > 
  > - Try to make changes which retain the internal consistency of the document, e.g. replacing a noun with a synonym throughout a paragraph or document.
  > - Making several tiny commits each couple of minutes is normal.

- Repeat until you've made the **minimum number of commits** which make sense for someone else to review and merge into the repository.
  
  > 📐 No PR is too small.
  > 
  > If you think your issue is too big to fix in one go, and you can see a way to break it down into several independent chunks, do that.

Each commit needs a commit message which contains:
- a summary of 50 characters or fewer, e.g. "fix: remove warning about citations in Characteristics section" or "feat: add new list of maintainers in overview".
- (optionally) a more detailed description.

> 💡 The CCV uses [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to make commit messages stylistically consistent and more technically useful.
> 
> Conventional commit summaries have the form `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
> - `<type>` is one of `feat` for a new feature which has been added, or `fix` for something which has been repaired.
> - `[optional scope]` is the part of the project which has been modified. In our case, this could be the section heading in the Wikipedia document.
> - `<description>` should tell the reader, familiar with the project, what was changed, and should make it easier to locate a particular commit you may wish to revert at a later time, 
> - If the change made breaks an existing interface, an `!` is appended after the `[optional scope]`, or `BREAKING CHANGE:` is added in the the optional description.

#### Using GitHub Desktop
GitHub Desktop automatically recognizes that you've made a changes to the files.

Add your commit summary and optional description in the field at the bottom left, and then press "commit to 12-your-branch-name-here".

#### Using `git` on the command line

Git needs to be told which of your files have been modified. "Stage" these files using the command `git add <filename>`, e.g.

```shell
git add git-text-content.md
```

To see a list of modified files and whether they are staged (*i.e.* going to be included in the next commit), run:

```shell
git status
```

Commit all of the staged files add add the commit **m**essage by running:
```shell
git commit -m "<your commit message here>"
```

If you want to include a longer description, run:
```shell
git commit -m "<your commit summary here>

<longer description here>
"
```
