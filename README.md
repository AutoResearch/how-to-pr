# dscov-github-workshop
Demonstration repository for the DScoV Lunch Workshop: Collaborative Coding for Science using Git, GitHub and Pull Requests

> ## ðŸŽ¯ Aim for the Workshop
> 
> We're going to collectively format a copy of the [Wikipedia page about Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) using "[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)," one of the text formats which GitHub uses for README files, comments on code, etc. 

## Approach 

- [**Start ðŸ”—**](how-to-start.md) We'll start from an incorrectly formatted version of the [Wikipedia page about Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), which you can find here: https://github.com/brown-ccv/dscov-github-workshop/blob/main/git-text-content.md. 
- [**Issue ðŸ”—**](how-to-issue.md): Each person will choose an issue. 
- [**Branch ðŸ”—**](how-to-branch.md): Each person will make a "branch" which can be shared, where they can make changes. 
- [**Commit ðŸ”—**](how-to-commit.md): Each person will make a series of "commits" where they actually fix the issue, bit-by-bit.
- [**Pull Request ðŸ”—**](how-to-pr.md): Each person will make a "pull request" (PR) which says "please incorporate the changes in *my* branch in *your* branch. 
  - The author of each PR will request a review from their peers.
  - Everyone will have the chance to look at the PR and suggest changes and improvements, or to say "this is great, let's merge it!"
  - The author of the PR will merge the approved PR.
- [**Update Pull Requests from the updated main branch ðŸ”—**](how-to-pr-update.md): All the other PRs can be updated to incorporate the new changes, before they too are merged. 
- [**Merge Conflicts ðŸ”—**](how-to-merge-conflict.md): If people work on the same part of the document, then the authors will resolve the conflicting changes. 

## Resources
- [GitHub flavoured Markdown ðŸ”—](https://github.github.com/gfm/) specifies precisely how to write Markdown text for GitHub
