# dscov-github-workshop
Demonstration repository for the DScoV Lunch Workshop: Collaborative Coding for Science using Git, GitHub and Pull Requests

## Aim for the Workshop

> ðŸŽ¯ We're going to collectively format a copy of the [Wikipedia page about Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) using "[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)," one of the text formats which GitHub uses for README files, comments on code, etc. 


## Approach 

- **Start** We'll start from an incorrectly formatted version of the [Wikipedia page about Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), which you can find here: https://github.com/brown-ccv/dscov-github-workshop/blob/main/git-text-content.md. 
- **Issue**: Each person will choose an issue.
- **Pull Request**: Each person will make a "pull request" (PR) to improve the part of the document referenced by the issue. 
  - The author of each PR will request a review from their peers.
  - Everyone will have the chance to look at the PR and suggest changes and improvements, or to say "this is great, let's merge it!"
  - The author will merge the approved PR.
- **Update Pull Requests**: All the other PRs can be updated to incorporate the new changes, before they too are merged. 
- **Merge Conflicts**: If people work on the same part of the document, then the authors will resolve the conflicting changes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- You have a GitHub account (get one here: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)).
- You have a way to clone and modify the repository on your machine:
  * either the [GitHub Desktop app](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop) (recommended) or
  * the [GitHub Command Line Tool `gh`](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) *and* the [Git command line tool `git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- You have a text editor ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) is commonly used and a pretty good general text editor.)

### Preparation
- Download the repository,
- Open the repository in your text editor.

## How to make a PR

### Choose your Issue
- Look at the [list of issues](https://github.com/brown-ccv/dscov-github-workshop/issues/) 
- Pick one you like. 
- Assign yourself to the PR. <img width="1110" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-05 at 15 35 27" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2803227/194147465-3e1cf130-4695-42c0-a758-8caf21124010.png">

### Make a Branch based on "main" where you'll solve the issue
There are several ways you can make a new branch.

- On the Issue Page on GitHub (the easiest option) <img width="1110" alt="Screen Shot 2022-10-05 at 15 46 03" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2803227/194149229-899e9a1c-a97d-47f4-adbc-a12dbd47d670.png">



### Solve the issue
Make a series of commits to solve the issue.
- Making small changes to the text, formatting 


Once you're done, repeat from step 1).

You can do this in one of three ways:

- You'll start a draft PR, with 

  - a high-level description and 
  - a link to the issue you're fixing. 
- Once you think you're done, please mark the PR as "ready for review" and request two or three reviewers.
## Definition of Done
A part of the document is done if it is:
- content-complete,
- free of factual errors,
- free of repetition,
- free of grammatical errors,
- correctly formatted when viewed in the preview.

- improve the formatting
