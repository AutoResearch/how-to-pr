# Make a Pull Request (PR)

> ⛔️TODO⛔️ include link to Notion "How to PR" detailed content for the interested. Finish that up and publish it before Friday.

You can do this in one of three ways:

- You'll start a draft PR, with

  - a link to the issue you're fixing. 
- Once you think you're done, please mark the PR as "ready for review" and request two or three reviewers.
