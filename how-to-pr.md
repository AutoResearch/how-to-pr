# Make a Pull Request (PR)

> ⛔️TODO⛔️ include link to Notion "How to PR" detailed content for the interested. Finish that up and publish it before Friday.

You can do this in one of three ways:

- You'll start a draft PR, with 

  - a high-level description and 
  - a link to the issue you're fixing. 
- Once you think you're done, please mark the PR as "ready for review" and request two or three reviewers.

## Make a Draft Pull Request

On the "create pull request" button, there is an arrow. Click this, and select "Draft pull request."

## Check everything

At this stage, you can check that everything is in place.

If you realise you need to do more work on the code, then [make some more commits on the same branch](how-to-commit.md) and push them using GitHub Desktop or `git push`. The PR will update automatically.

## Mark the Pull Request as "Ready for review"

When you click "ready for review" at the bottom of the pull request conversation, the reviewers will be informed that you've requested their review.

At this stage, it's best to not make any more updates until the reviewers are finished and have given their feedback. It can be frustrating for the reviewer if the code changes during their review.

If you realise that the code needs updating more, then re-mark the PR as a draft. Your reviewers will be able to see that the PR is no longer ready for review.

## Wait for feedback
Wait until you have the amount of feedback you need.
